# Signal_Processing
Programms made on signal processing course

1 - Aliasing effect - simulationg aliasing effect on sin function then making animation from it.

2 - Lena - Ortagonal base, exercise based on understading low and high pass filter including fast fourier transform

3 - Mozaicking - simulation of camera matrix, making CMOS image and then using interpolation producing original picture. At the end comparing it

4 - Denoising - denoising image using three diffrent algorithms

5 - Rotating - algorithms to rotate and scale images
